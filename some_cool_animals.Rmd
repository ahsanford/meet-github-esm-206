## Github

In Github we have all the file folders we need for what we are doing [today](https://github.com/allisonhorst/meet-github-esm-206)

First, we will make our own copy by using the `fork`button on github.

- Once we fork, we will see our username alongside the name of the repository. Repository is often called `repo`.

Next, we will `clone` the repo so that we can use, manipulate, and visualize data in Rstudio. Hit the green code button, then copy the HTTPS url. 

Create a new Rproject. Select `version control` and then `clone git repository`. Paste your URL into the `repository URL` box. The project directory name will auto populate. Then selecte where you want your project to be stored on your computer.Then click create, and you will have your Rmarkdown document!



##### A note on this project:

The organization of this document probably seems strange. That's because it's part of an entire multi-part lab for ESM 206, which students will create in multiple projects (but are combined here for easier sharing). Hence the weird unrelated pieces all put together in this project (students will create Parts 2 & 3 as separate projects).

# Creating multiple tabs in an r markdown #

You can see an example of tabs by clicking the `some_cool_animals.RMD` R markdown document and knitting.

Use the following to create a tab: 

- R will automatically rank these in order for your tabs dependent on the number of hastags you use. 

**### Cool animal fun facts {.tabset .tabset-fade}**

#### This is how to make a tab in Rmarkdown!

If you clone a project from github, you should be able to just hit knit in Rstudio and everything will work. This is the same for the projects that YOU upload.

You need to have a blank line above the tab code, then your hashtags, then a space. 

Scroll down to the 'Ringtail cat' tab or example for more details and instructions about how to do these things.

#### SHARKS!!!

##### Some great white shark facts (from [NatGeo Kids](https://www.natgeokids.com/uk/discover/animals/sea-life/great-white-sharks/)):

- Great white sharks have ~ 300 teeth
- And swim way faster than you (25 mph)
- And are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List

#### California condors

##### Some California condor facts (from [Animal Fact Guide](https://animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/california-condor/)):

- By 1987, there were only 10 California condors living in the wild
- They are the largest flying bird in North America
- Critically endangered on the IUCN Red List (> 400 today)

#### American pika

##### Some American pika facts (from [OneKindPlanet.org](https://onekindplanet.org/animal/pika-american/)):

- Pika are of order *Lagomorpha* (which also includes rabbits)
- Pika live in high altitude talus slopes
- American pika are already disappearing from the Sierra Nevada

#### Ring-tailed Cats

Here's where I want to have info on ringtails.

If we want a caption for a figure, put an exclamation point, box parenthesis, then normal parenthesis. The file path to get the image goes in your parentheses. The file path should always start in your rmarkdown folder like the data folder in previous labs.

We'll also learn about `knitr::include_graphics` which lets you put images into documents.

#### To send your edits back to R Github

In the Git tab in the top right box, stage both of your files. i.e. select both boxes and hit the `commit` button that has papers and a check mark on it. Then type in a commit message to the box that pops up that descriptively says what you added in few words.

You will see a message in the git tab next to a blue circled `I`. 'Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by commit. 

- This is an indicator that you haven't actually sent the changes that you have made back to github. 
- So we want to `push` to github by selecting the green up arrow in the git tab.
- Now go back to github and refresh your repository. You will see your new changes there if you did it right!
